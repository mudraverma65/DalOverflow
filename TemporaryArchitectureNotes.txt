It is jst for recording the incremental changes that we would need in the project to make it more robust.

Database:
1)The primary ke column is varchar. would be better if its text. the PK should be auto increment in the database.
2)Check the logic behind the random pk generated in the seeding data if that is needed.
3) we might have to change the seed data to accommodate the changes in the PK.

Utils class:
We have added a basic utility class DALOUtility to the project.
Add the basic utilities like encyrption logic, basic parsers to this class.
The methods should be static so that it can be used appropriately.

VM:
We need to upgrade the openjdk version of the VM to accommodate latest java files being complied and pushed to the repo.

Question table:
we need have a column for question status. I.e if the question is already answered.
we need to fetch answer count somewhere.i.e how many answers are there to a particular question.

Answer table :
we currently have a_status table whic will indicate if this is the answer selected by the user
default value should be false.
once the question user marks this answer correct, then the value should be marked true.

Editing a question:
we should let the user who is posting the question to edit and delete the question posted.
similarly we should also the user who is posting th answer to edit and delete the answer if its not marked answered by the question user.

we need to add comments module to the question answer thread.

How will the user posting the question decide which answer to select.
we need a UI component to select an answer from the list of answers which also marks the question complete.
