It is jst for recording the incremental changes that we would need in the project to make it more robust.

Database:
1)The primary ke column is varchar. would be better if its text. the PK should be auto increment in the database.
2)Check the logic behind the random pk generated in the seeding data if that is needed.
3) we might have to change the seed data to accommodate the changes in the PK.

Utils class:
We have added a basic utility class DALOUtility to the project.
Add the basic utilities like encyrption logic, basic parsers to this class.
The methods should be static so that it can be used appropriately.

VM:
We need to upgrade the openjdk version of the VM to accommodate latest java files being complied and pushed to the repo.
